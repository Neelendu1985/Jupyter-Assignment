# # H1: Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# - List of popular languages for Data Science
# - List of popular Libraries for Data Science
# - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools
# - Evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# - Insert a markdown cell

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. SQL
# 3. R

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. TensorFlow
# 2. NumPy
# 3. SciPy
# 4. Pandas

# | Data Science Tools|

# ### H3: Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[3]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[5]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60
